    <h3>Career Goals</h3> 
    <p>As a senior majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems, my career goal is to start in a role where I can apply both my analytical and business skills to solve real-world problems, while continuing to grow my technical expertise in tools like SQL, Python, and data visualization. In the next few years, I aim to gain hands-on experience, earn relevant certifications, and take on projects that allow me to bridge the gap between data and business strategy. Long term, I aspire to move into leadership roles where I can guide teams, influence strategy, and drive innovation at the intersection of data, technology, and business.</p>
